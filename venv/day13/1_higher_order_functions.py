# If a function takes another function as an argument then the function is called
# higher-order function

# Some important features of python functions
# 1. Functions can be stored in a variable
def multiply(a,b):
    return a * b
m = multiply
result = m(2,3)
print(result)


# 2. Function can be an element of python data structures like list and tuple
def addition(a, b):
    return a + b


def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

data = [addition,multiply,1,2,"a"]
x = data[0](2,3)
print(x(2,3))

# 3. A function can take another function as an argument

# Built-in higher order functions in python
# map(), filter() and reduce()
